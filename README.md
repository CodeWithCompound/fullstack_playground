# fullstack playground
a small test project where i'm learning how frontend and backend work together.
the backend is a simple express server, and the frontend is built with vite.
right now it just sends a message from the server to the client, but i'll expand it as i learn more.

# what it does
basic express api (node.js)
frontend fetches data from the backend
both run locally on different ports
good place for me to practice full stack stuff

# tech used
javascript
node.js + express
vite
