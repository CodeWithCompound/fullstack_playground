# fullstack playground
a small test project where i'm learning how frontend and backend work together.
the backend is a simple express server, and the frontend is built with vite.
right now it just sends a message from the server to the client, but i'll expand it as i learn more.

# what it does
basic express api (node.js)
frontend fetches data from the backend
both run locally on different ports
good place for me to practice full stack stuff

# tech used
javascript
node.js + express
vite

# how it felt
i considered never touching javascript again, same with html and css
i will not become a fullstack developer with javascript, no
i hated the project
i will learn go for backend because i wanna do backend
and rust as my personal favourite
